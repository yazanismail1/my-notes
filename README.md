## **Fundamentals of a Good Developer Mindset Recap**
A good developer is the one with a **good mindset**.

### **<u>Conceiving The Purpose of Software:</u>**
* Understand the purpose of the software.
* The main goal is to help people.

### **<u>The Goals of Software Design:</u>**
* The software must help the users now and continue in the future, if you design a bad system, your software's lifetime will be short, in addition, Your design should be easy for you and helpful for others.

### **<u>(Mis)understanding:</u>**
* Always fully understand the work needed to be done, understand the system and tools you are working with.
* >Understanding is the key difference between a bad developer and a good developer. - _Max Kanat-Alexander, Code Simplicity_

### **<u>Simplicity:</u>**
* The more the code is simple the better it is.
* Writing complex code to impress others won't make you look smart. Developers who are new to your code donâ€™t know anything about it; they have to learn.
* > Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. - _Leonardo da Vinci_

### **<u>Complexity:</u>**
* The source of many software failures is complexity.
* Know your software purpose and evaluate the features based on purpose.
* If not evaluated correctly more features will be implemented which is unnecessary concluding in a complex code.

### **<u>Maintenance:</u>**
* It is more important to reduce the effort of maintenance than it is to reduce the effort of implementation.

### **<u>Consistency:</u>**
* Consistency is a big part of simplicity.
* If you name a variable (anyName), then stick to it, don't name another variable (any_name).

### **<u>Prioritizing:</u>**
* Always answer the following questions when an implementation is needed.
    
    * How much do you want that change to happen?
    * How much value does the change offer? How much does it help your users?
    * How much work will you need to do to accomplish this change?
    * > The desirability of any change is directly proportional to the value of the change and inversely proportional to the effort involved in making the change. - _Code Simplicity_

### **<u>Problem Solving:</u>**
* If you truely understood the problem, the issue is half solved.
* If you can't explain the problem to a five years old, you did not understand the problem.
* Think before acting.

### **<u>Good enough is fine:</u>**
* Chasing perfection will cause:
    
    * You will be writing code that isnâ€™t needed.
    * You will increase complexity by adding unnecessary codes.
    * You will be too generic.
    * You will be missing deadlines.
    * You will be dealing with many bugs caused by the complexity.
* Start small, improve it, then extend.

### **<u>Predictions:</u>**
* You canâ€™t predict the future, so no matter how generic your solution is, it will not be generic enough to satisfy the actual future requirements you will have.
* Being too generic involves a lot of code that isnâ€™t needed.

### **<u>Assumptions:</u>**
* > Code should be designed based on what you know now, not on what you think will happen in the future.â€Š- _Code Simplicity_

### **<u>Stop Reinventing:</u>**
* Don't reinvent the wheel.

### **<u>Resistance:</u>**
* As a developer, your first reaction to changing requests should be â€œNOâ€™â€™, unless it is really necessary.

### **<u>Automation:</u>**
* Donâ€™t spend your time on repetitive tasks. Set them up and forget about them. They can work while you are sleeping.
* If you can automate it, automate it.

### **<u>Code measurement:</u>**
* A good code is not either a short code or a long code.
* The optimum code is a small bunch of code that is easy to understand, easy to read.
* A short code may fall in a trap that will cause writing complex code to be fixed.
* > Measuring programming progress by lines of code is like measuring aircraft building progress by weight. - _Bill Gates_

### **<u>Productivity:</u>**
* Your main goal should be keeping your code base as small as possible.

### **<u>Testing:</u>**
* Test your code every time a feature is added, part by part and as a whole once it is done.
* Untested code is the code that doesnâ€™t work.

### **<u>(Under)Estimate:</u>**
* Break the big thing into smaller things. The smaller it is, the easier it is to estimate.
* Everything takes longer than you think.

### **<u>Running Away From Rewriting:</u>**
* Rewriting code is often a developer delusion, not the solution in most cases.
 * Refactoring should be the first option.
 
### **<u>Documentation and Commenting:</u>**
* Write a comment to explain "WHY", not explain "WHAT".
* When you canâ€™t make the code simpler then you should add the comment to explain this complexity.
* Documentation is to explain the high-level picture of your software.

### **<u>Picking Technologies:</u>**
* Donâ€™t depend on external technologies. But when you have to do so, try to reduce your dependency on them as much as you can.
 * When using an external tools, answer the following:
    * Is there active development behind it?
    * Will it continue to be maintained?
    * How easy is it to switch away from?
    * What does the community say about it?

### **<u>Self-Development:</u>**
* KEEP LEARNING.

### **<u>Donâ€™t be a hero:</u>**
* Donâ€™t be obsessive. Know when to quit. Donâ€™t hesitate to ask for help.

### **<u>Donâ€™t Ask Questionsâ€¦ Ask For Help:</u>**
* Try to solve the problem, then try again, search, and try again then seek advice.
